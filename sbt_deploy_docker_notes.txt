#### enable dockerplugin in sbt
1. add sbt native packager plugin to plugins.sbt under project
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.8.0")
2. enable plugins in build.sbt
lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala,JavaAppPackaging,LauncherJarPlugin)
LauncherJarPlugin is required for windows to be able to launch applications
3. run sbt stage 
4. then in target/uinversal/stage/bin we have the applications
to run playdtreeservice 
do 
target/uinversal/stage/bin/playdtreeservice
we will need to have the MLPLocation environmental variable set
that is assinged to floc
which we use in configuration to get the location of mleap zip package

for docker run
did sbt playUpdateSecret  to add the secret to application.conf file
made modifications in build.sbt to change docker image name that is applied when we do sbt docker:publishLocal
added some commands to include bash in the image
sbt stage:docker
that generates a Dockerfile
check in target/docker/stage
need the mleap zip file 
so add to the Docerfile the zip file from the local file system
copied it to directory 1 under stage
now when we run the docker container we should have the application running in a docker container
